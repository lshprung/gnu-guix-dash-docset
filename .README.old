Here is a script and a Makefile for generating a GNU Guix docset for Dash. The script is based on the dash-docset-generation-template

- GNU Guix: https://guix.gnu.org/
- Dash: https://kapeli.com/dash
- dash-docset-generation-template: https://github.com/lshprung/dash-docset-generation-template

To generate a docset from the latest edition of the GNU Guix Manual, simply
execute `make [VERSION=...]` from the same directory as this README file. The latest edition
will be downloaded from ftpmirror.gnu.org and packaged appropriately.

Requirements (not including requirements for building the upstream doc source):

- any POSIX-compliant shell
- curl    - https://curl.se/
- make    - https://www.gnu.org/software/make/
- pup     - https://github.com/ericchiang/pup
- sqlite3 - https://www.sqlite.org/index.html
